An explorer for multiple directories

## Quickstart

- Size 
- Protection Bits

*These are the comands currently avaiable:*
~~~
    tab              : move to the next section
    q  / ^C  /  esc  : quit
    c                : Compress the item selected with the chosen algorithm
    d                : Decompress the item selected with the chosen algorithm
    s                : move down in the current section
    w                : move up in the current section
    Enter            : open the selected element
    '/'              : search in the current section
    c                : compress the item currently selected
    1-9              : select the n-th item in the current section
    r                : rename the item currently selected
    m                : Move the item currently selected to the other folder open
    <F5>             : Copy the item selected to the other folder open
    x                : Delete an item
    
    'Any Other'      : refresh the current section and do nothing
    
~~~
by the command line, you can use the following arguments:

~~~
usage: hse.py [-h] [-l LOG] [-c CONFIG] [-o OUTPUT] [-c1 COMPRESS_LEVEL] [-c4 {lz4,bz2,gzip,zlib}] [-v]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LOG, --log LOG     Path to the log file
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        configuration file to use
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Path to the output file
  -c1 COMPRESS_LEVEL, --compress-level COMPRESS_LEVEL
                        level of compression
  -c4 {lz4,bz2,gzip,zlib}, --compress-algorithm {lz4,bz2,gzip,zlib}
                        algorithm of compression
  -v, --verbose         verbose mode
~~~

The default configuration is structured as follows:
~~~json
{
    "log":{
        "verbose":false,
        "path":"./logs/info.log",
        "format":"[ %(asctime)s ] %(levelname)s: %(message)s",
        "datefmt":"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %p"},
    "path_1":".",
    "path_2":".",
    "last_save":{
        "year":2022,
        "month":6,
        "day":6
    },
    "last_load":{
        "year":2022,
        "month":6,
        "day":6
    }
}
~~~
Obviously, you can change the configuration as long as you don't change the name of the file.
